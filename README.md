# Webapp3
This is a way for people to convert their old webapp2 classes to make them work with python3 using Flask

You can also install using pip3 install webapp3-flask==0.1.0

If you are doing a pip install it is recommended that you install it using pip3 install  -r requirements.txt and listing webapp3-flask==0.1.0 in your requirements.txt

Also, if you pip install you must use: 

import webapp3

from webapp3.webapp3 import *

or

import webapp3
from webapp3.webapp3 import Response,BaseHandler, RequestHandler,webapp2,webappGet,webappPost
